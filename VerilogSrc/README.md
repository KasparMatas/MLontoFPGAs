# Verilgo source files
Here you can find the source and simulation files in Verilog. The most important file here is the simulation file called generated_model_simulator.v which contains the an output from the MLontoFPGAs.py file with some test cases validating that the model still works in HW.

Currently all of the tests aren't working because all of the simulations or source files aren't up to date but they give a rough idea how the model works on an FPGA.
