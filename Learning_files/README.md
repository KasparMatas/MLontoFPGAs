# Learning files
These files have nothing to do in the implementation of the tool but are created while trying to understand the different aspects of TensorFlow and Keras.

All of these files were crucial to understand before starting working on the project.

### createKerasModel
Python file which creates and saves a model using the Keras API.

### loadKerasModel
Python file which loads the model created by createKerasModel.py and runs it.

### createTensorFlowModel
Python file which creates and saves a model using the SavedModel API.

### loadTensorFlowModel
Python file which loads the model created by createTensorFlowModel.py and runs it and analyses the model as well.

### runTranslatedKerasModel
Python file which just creates a model an runs it. It is the same model as in the createKerasModel.py but made only without the Keras API
